# This is War

This was my first JavaScript project. It started out as a regular HTML/CSS/JS project
but then I learned about React and scrapped pretty much everything and made it a React app.

## Why War?

I watched [whatsdev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0) on YouTube make Rock, Paper, Scissors and that inspired me to recreate another game I used to play as a kid - War. It's a simple game with simple rules and it doesn't require any skill at all which made it the perfect game to play with my older siblings growing up.

### Issues I've observed

Since so many things are happening asynchronously in this app, it's prone to glitching a bit. Glitches I've observed include a card "flipping" before it's supposed to or later than expected, but nothing that will flat out break the app.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
